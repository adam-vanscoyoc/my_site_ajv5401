   <h1>DIGIT 100 Essay</h1>

<p>Overall I enjoyed working with both tools to build websites, and feel that I learned a lot of information about</p>
        <p>each that I didn’t know before I took this class. It’s hard for me to decide which tool I liked better, I feel</p>
        <p>WordPress was a lot easier to work with for me but I also recognize that GitHub seems to have a lot more</p>    
        <p>potential and let you do so much more once you understand it. Initially I struggled with understanding how</p>
        <p>GitHub/GitBash/Oxygen worked, but overtime I feel I’ve become more proficient at using these tools and</p>
        <p>now see how useful it is. I think that once I gain a full understanding of GitHub, I will like it significantly</p>
        <p>more than WordPress, but for just starting out WordPress was a little easier to use. I did however run into a</p>
        <p>lot of small problems with WordPress and also felt very limited in what I could do. While it was nice having</p>
        <p>templates or preset components to the website, I wasn’t able to customize every small detail which is a reason</p>
        <p>why I think I would like GitHub better in the future. One thing about GitHub that I like a lot more than</p>
        <p>WordPress was how well it kept track of your progress and would allow you to revert to previous points in</p>
        <p>the project. That was extremely helpful and something that I felt was lacking in WordPress. All in all I believe</p>
        <p>that GitHub is the better tool to use, but for a beginner WordPress was a little easier to use.</p>
