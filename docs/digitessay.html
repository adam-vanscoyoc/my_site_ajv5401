            <h2>Digit 100 Corpus Analysis Assignment</h2>
            <section>   
                <p>For the Corpus Analysis assignment, I was trying to think of a few possible </p>
                <p>comparisons between the two works Hamlet and Macbeth. I decided to work with these </p>
                <p>two because I have had to read each of them in the past, and because I thought it </p>
                <p>would be pretty interesting to compare two of Shakespeare's work and see if there were </p>
                <p>any similarities or differences in his work.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>I tried to analyze a few different things for each work while trying to maintain a </p>
                <p>sort of overarching theme. My first main theme was trying to find words that appear in </p>
                <p>each work but have different meanings. As I was searching for words that matched this </p>
                <p>idea, I found that the word 'water' appeared pretty frequently in each work, but had two </p>
                <p>surprisingly different meanings. Once I found that this word was pretty common, I </p>
                <p>increased the ngram size and tried to look at the context that this word was in and what </p>
                <p>'water' meant in each context.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>In Macbeth, water is extremely commonly used as a 'purifying word'. It appeared </p>
                <p>alongside other words such as 'clears' and 'washes'. I was surprised that it was so </p>
                <p>commonly referred to in this context, and that this context was a lot more common than </p>
                <p>any other references. After comparing it to Hamlet's use of the word, I found it even </p>
                <p>more interesting that the same word was used in such different ways even though each </p>
                <p>piece was so similar (a tragedy) and was written by the same author.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>In Hamlet however, the word was used almost specifically in the context of </p>
                <p>'drowning'. It appeared commonly before the literal word 'drown' or 'drowns'. There were </p>
                <p>only a few sentences where the word was not used under this context.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The next large theme that I decided to look at was the occurrence of death </p>
                <p>related words compared to the amount of character deaths in each play. This topic </p>
                <p>actually came out pretty interesting to me personally, because I found a pretty large </p>
                <p>correlation between each of these.
                </p>
                
                <p>I found that 'death' related words such as: death, dead, blood, died, appeared </p>
                <p>pretty commonly in each as they are both tragedies. These words in particular appeared </p>
                <p>93 times in Hamlet, while appearing 66 times in Macbeth. The interesting part to me is </p>
                <p>that this means that these words appeared almost 1.5 times more likely in Hamlet </p>
                <p>(1.41), and when looking at the amount of character deaths in each play there were 9 to </p>
                <p>Hamlet and 5 to Macbeth. This means that there were 1.8 times more character deaths </p>
                <p>in Hamlet than in Macbeth, which is relatively close to the amount of times the ratio of </p>
                <p>the words per play.
                </p>
                
                <p>I find this interesting because it makes me think that possibly Shakespeare had </p>
                <p>written Hamlet with the preconceived idea of having more death and tragedy, and that it </p>
                <p>might show in the correlation to the amount of times death and tragic related words </p>
                <p>were used in each play, as well as the amount of character deaths per play. While I'm </p>
                <p>not sure what to do with this information, I do find it pretty fascinating that there was </p>
                <p>such a difference per each play, as I expected them to be somewhat similar; or at least </p>
                <p>more similar than what the results had shown.
                </p>

            <h2>Digit 100 Essay</h2>
            <section>   
                <p>Overall I enjoyed working with both tools to build websites, and feel that I learned a lot of information about</p>
                <p>each that I didn’t know before I took this class. It’s hard for me to decide which tool I liked better, I feel</p>
                <p>WordPress was a lot easier to work with for me but I also recognize that GitHub seems to have a lot more</p>    
                <p>potential and let you do so much more once you understand it. Initially I struggled with understanding how</p>
                <p>GitHub/GitBash/Oxygen worked, but overtime I feel I’ve become more proficient at using these tools and</p>
                <p>now see how useful it is. I think that once I gain a full understanding of GitHub, I will like it significantly</p>
                <p>more than WordPress, but for just starting out WordPress was a little easier to use. I did however run into a</p>
                <p>lot of small problems with WordPress and also felt very limited in what I could do. While it was nice having</p>
                <p>templates or preset components to the website, I wasn’t able to customize every small detail which is a reason</p>
                <p>why I think I would like GitHub better in the future. One thing about GitHub that I like a lot more than</p>
                <p>WordPress was how well it kept track of your progress and would allow you to revert to previous points in</p>
                <p>the project. That was extremely helpful and something that I felt was lacking in WordPress. All in all I believe</p>
                <p>that GitHub is the better tool to use, but for a beginner WordPress was a little easier to use.</p>
