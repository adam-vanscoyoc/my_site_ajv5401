            <h2>Veinless Property</h2>
            <h3>This page contains my report on the horror game "Veinless Property".</h3>
            
            <section>
                <h2>GAME ENVIRONMENT</h2>
                <p>This game takes place solely in a small, dark house. The creator of this game does a </p>    
                <p>really good job of painting a creepy, eerie environment almost effortlessly and </p>
                <p>minimalistically.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Your very first objective is to turn off all of the lights in the house before you go to bed. </p> 
                <p>While this is fairly straightforward, I feel it does a great job of smoothly allowing the </p> 
                <p>player to familiarize themselves with their environment, and also strongly adds to the </p> 
                <p>horror effect of the game. By turning off all of the lights, you are almost forced to wonder </p> 
                <p>"What's in the dark? What's coming after me?" and by giving almost no visual </p>
                <p>stimulation, strictly auditory at parts, it forces your imagination and almost paranoia to </p>
                <p>run wild.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The game is also entirely in black and red, which I find adds to the effectiveness of the </p>    
                <p>game and creates an interesting and unique art style that I honestly have never seen </p>
                <p>before.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Overall I would say that the environment is one of the strongest components of this </p>    
                <p>game. I think it is very well done and speaks for itself without having to say much at all. </p>
                <p>It's minimalist, creepy, and horrifying at times.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Below is an image that I feel captures the environment of the game and the creators </p>    
                <p>attention to small details that can have a huge effect on the player. As I was exploring</p>
                <p>the environment I looked out one of the windows as it was the only source of light in the</p>
                <p>area. While it's a really small detail that can be easily overlooked, I thought it was very </p>    
                <p>interesting and creepy that one of the mountains resembled a face</p>

                <h2>CHARACTERS</h2>
                <p>Just as the environment was very simple and minimalist, so too were the characters. </p>    
                <p>Little to nothing is known about the few characters in this game, but it appears you are </p>
                <p>playing as a son/daughter who is home alone for a brief period of time. All in all, nothing </p>
                <p>else is really know about the character that you play. Part of me wishes there was a little </p>
                <p>more story involved in it, but part of me also enjoys the mystery and lack of known </p>
                <p>information because it allows you to imagine the rest of the story.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The only other characters that are seen in this game are even less known about. At the </p>
                <p>finale of the game, you meet the two creatures that have been making horrifying sounds </p>
                <p>throughout the game (such as banging on your front door until you answer, crashing </p>
                <p>and breaking in through a window, and breathing heavily that is audible through the </p>
                <p>house).</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>These characters are extremely scary, horrifying creatures that are honestly difficult to </p>
                <p>describe. They look skinny, and covered in blood.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Below is a picture of the only other two characters in the entire game:</p>
                <br></br>

                <h2>OBJECTS</h2>
                <p>This game does actually use objects and objectives to keep everything flowing smoothly </p>    
                <p>and to add to the horror factor of it. There are a few notable objects that are used/seen </p>
                <p>throughout the game, and the most distinct one would probably be the knife.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>I remember this object the most because I can remember genuinely feeling a little </p>
                <p>scared when I heard something break through a window in the other room, and a </p>
                <p>message pops up that simply says: "find something to defend yourself". At this point I </p>
                <p>was really scared that if I couldn't find something fast enough, the creatures would be </p>
                <p>coming after me so I scrambled around looking for a weapon.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>It was actually somewhat difficult to find the knife because the objective was very </p>
                <p>unclear so I spent a decent amount of time scrambling through rooms looking for </p>
                <p>anything that could be a weapon. Looking back I find this very interesting because I feel </p>
                <p>like it almost recreates the actual feeling you would have if this had happened in real </p>
                <p>life. Eventually you come across a knife in your kitchen, which you carry with you for the </p>
                <p>remainder of the game.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Other than that, the only other objects really used or seen would be the lightswitches. </p>
                <p>Again, these were mainly used at the start when you had to turn all of the lights off in </p>
                <p>the entire house, but are seen more when more noises and disturbances occur </p>
                <p>throughout the house.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Here are some images to capture the objects discussed above:
                </p>

                <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                <p>I would say one of the biggest challenges of the game would be the lack of direction. It </p> 
                <p>can feel almost disorienting at times, which sounds like a negative but I would honestly </p>
                <p>argue that it was in the games benefit.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Both the lack of direction and the lack of visuals (as most of the game was extremely </p>
                <p>dark and hard to see) really added to the horror of the game. It made me feel like I </p>
                <p>wasn't really the one who was in control, it made me feel lost and scared of what was to </p>
                <p>come next.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The lack of visuals was especially challenging, I feel almost like it was a little bit </p>
                <p>unnecessary, as some parts I had to hunt through the pitch black to find the last light </p>
                <p>switch that I need to turn off so my character can go to bed. While to a certain extent I </p>
                <p>do believe it added to the game, eventually it did feel a little tedious.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The lack of direction is something I almost never see in video games, I'm not sure if the </p>
                <p>effects were intentional or not but the feeling of being lost and not sure what's going on </p>
                <p>made me significantly more afraid of what could be lurking through the house. I think </p>
                <p>it'sa very interesting concept that I'm surprised not to see so much in other video </p>
                <p>games, as most video games seem to give you very clear cut and easy to understand </p>
                <p>objectives.
                </p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts:</h2>
                <p>All in all I did very much enjoy this game and thought that it brought some really </p> 
                <p>interesting and unique concepts to the table. My largest critique of the game is that I feel </p>
                <p>it wasn't long enough, I started to feel immersed in the environment of the game and </p>
                <p>was getting really interested where the story and game was heading, and I feel the </p>
                <p>ending was a little to abrupt and left too many unanswered questions. However that </p>
                <p>does not take away from the strong points of the game, the strongest of which I would </p>
                <p>say was the environment, the art style, and the minimalist nature of the game that gave </p>
                <p>room for the player's imagination.
                </p>
