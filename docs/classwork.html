                <p>In my CMPET 211 class, we learned how to code in C as well as build various electrical circuits. Using both</p>    
                <p>of these in combination we were able to accomplish multiple different projects assigned to us, that were</p>
                <p>mainly self guided projects.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Here is one example of how we had to design and streamline the code for a 7 segment, as well as design and</p> 
                <p>build the 7 segment electrical circuit. 7 segment displays are essentially the inner workings of an alarm clock,</p> 
                <p>as well as many other clocks/number displays. Learning how to both code and build one of these from</p> 
                <p>scratch was very interesting, and I enjoyed getting to see how these worked.</p>
