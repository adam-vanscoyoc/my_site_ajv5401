                <h2>CMPET 211: Coding in C</h2>
                <p>In my CMPET 211 class, we learned how to code in C as well as build various electrical circuits. Using both</p>    
                <p>of these in combination we were able to accomplish multiple different projects assigned to us, that were</p>
                <p>mainly self guided projects.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Here is one example of how we had to design and streamline the code for a 7 segment, as well as design and</p> 
                <p>build the 7 segment electrical circuit. 7 segment displays are essentially the inner workings of an alarm clock,</p> 
                <p>as well as many other clocks/number displays. Learning how to both code and build one of these from</p> 
                <p>scratch was very interesting, and I enjoyed getting to see how these worked.</p>

                <h2>CMPSC 121: Coding in C++</h2>
                <p>This is just an example as to how I take my notes for my coding classes. I try to keep my notes well organized</p>    
                <p>so that while I’m coding I can very easily access different commands and functions, which allows me to code</p>
                <p>and learn how to code a lot faster.</p>
