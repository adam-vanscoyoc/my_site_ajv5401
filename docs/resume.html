                <h2> WORK AND EXPERIENCE</h2>
                <div> VARIOUS TECH JOBS — I.T. Assistant/Job Shadowing 2012 - Present </div>  
                <div>    Over the years
                    I've gained a lot of opportunities to work in the tech field because my Dad is
                    the head IT director for a large Highschool. Whether it was getting the chance
                    to see how he coordinates a team of people to work efficiently together, or
                    helping with more technical work, I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to
                    pick up this experience.</div>
                
                <div> FEDEX GROUND, New Stanton PA — Package Handler May 2018-Present</div>    
                <div>    Working at
                    FedEx ground has taught me the importance of discipline and working hard no
                    matter what. My shift is usually from 2:00AM-9:00AM and involves a lot of manual
                    labor, discipline, and teamwork.</div>
                
                <div> DOORDASH, Erie — Doordash Driver May 2020 - Present</div>
                <div>    While this job is not very
                    related to my field, I still wanted to use it as an example of my work ethic.
                    Amidst a global pandemic and amidst the strain of my Junior level Engineering
                    classes, it was still very important to me to have a way to make money while
                    getting through college, so I continued to work in whatever field I could.</div>
